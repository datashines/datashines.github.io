title: Getting an Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) in the UK
---

When you come and live in the UK for a while, at some point, you can become eligible to apply for the settlement status. 
This is equivalent to getting a Permanent Residence (PR) or as they call it here : Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR).
On 23rd September, 2021, I received the confirmation letter from the Home Office, UK regarding the approval of my ILR:

    </embed>
</object>

And subsequently on 29th September, 2021 I received my Biometric Residence Permit (BRP) card. In this blog post, I am
going to elaborately specify the steps and attach the various documents that I gathered to make my application. Hope this 
will be helpful for folks who are, soon to or in process of, making their ILR applications.


##  Rules for eligibility

For people who live and work in the UK, they can be eligible for an ILR in any duration between 2 to 5 years depending on the
type of visa. A majority of expat workers have a tier-2 visa which requires 5 years. However for different types of tier-1 visas,
the time can be 2 or 3 years. These rules are subject to updates and best to check them out at 
the [government website](https://www.gov.uk/indefinite-leave-to-remain).

#### My case
I arrived to the UK in September 2018, and lived for about a year on tier-2 visa. Subsequently got my tier-1 exceptional
talent visa in 2019. You can read all the details about my tier-1 visa application story in my 
[previous blog post](https://datashines.github.io/How-I-received-my-Tier-1-Exceptional-Talent-UK-visa/). With a tier-1
exceptional talent visa, you need 3 years until you are eligible for the ILR. However, these 3 years can be inclusive 
of your time spent under tier-2 as well. Therefore for me, instead of becoming eligible for my ILR in 2022, I was already
eligible by September 2021. And that is when I made my application.


```
Although this section might not be particularly useful for your visa application process, I will briefly mention why I needed to apply for this
visa in the first place. In February, 2019, I received a LinkedIn message from a partner at [Antler](https://www.antler.co/), which is a well known startup accelerator.

I found this an interesting opportunity and moved the conversation forward. I managed to clear the interviews and was offered to be a founder in their first London-cohort.
At the time, I was working in London with a tier-2 general visa. Because this visa is sponsored by an employer, and because Antler is not an employer per se, I needed to 
switch to a tier-1 visa to be able to function as a founder in their cohort program. This is where my story for applying for a tier-1 visa started. And with the help of consultations from Antler, I started applying for an Exceptional Talent Tier-1 UK Visa.

## Life in the UK test

Before even going into the whole - gathering of various documents - phase, I saw that there are 2 strict requirements for this application.
One of them is - having a thorough knowledge and understanding of life in the UK. [This](https://www.gov.uk/life-in-the-uk-test) is the 
official website for life in the UK test, where you can know more about it and more importantly book a test. It costs 50Â£. You'll have
to answer 24 multiple choice type questions in 45 minutes. You must score 75% or above, i.e. at least 18 questions should be answered correctly.
One good thing is that once you pass this test, the scorecard is valid indefinitely. Hence, you can work on this test anytime before your ILR
application eligibility date and get past this checkpoint.

#### My case
I used this [wonderful resource (free)](https://lifeintheuktestweb.co.uk/test-1/) to prepare for the test. I have to admit that I 
over-prepped to only realise that the actual test was not that difficult. I prepped slowly and steadily over 1.5 months wherein I 
first went through the reading material given in the resource. And then I started practising the mock tests. My suggestion would be
to focus more on practising the mock tests and less on mugging the texts, because at least for me, the actual test literally had
questions straight-up from the mock tests. Just make sure you are consistently scoring above 90% or so across mock tests and at that
point you'll be good to go. The test appointments can be busy, hence, make sure to book one well within time. In reality you'll most certainly
not need 45 minutes to finish. It took less than 5 minutes in my case.

## English language requirement
This is the second critical requirement for the ILR application. There are different ways of proving your English language ability. Two
of the most popular routes are
- Using university degrees ensuring English was the main language of education, or
- Taking one of those English language tests (IELTS)
Please go through the [official website](https://www.gov.uk/english-language) to understand what might be applicable for you.

#### My case
Thankfully, why applying for my tier-2 visa in 2018, I had to prove my English language ability. For that, I had used my 
University degrees both from Undergrad as well as Grad Uni. Essentially, I had received a certificate from NARIC (the then government 
body for certifying English language levels) certifying my language levels. And I was able to re-use that certificate again
this time for my ILR application.


```
Tech Nation website provides an extensive explanation of their application process [on their visa guide page](https://technation.io/visa-tech-nation-visa-guide).
To start your application you need to go to the [apply page](https://technation.io/visa/apply). This will require you to sign up with an email id in order to begin
the application process. 

You can find below my downloaded pre-filled Tech Nation application form:

<object data="{{ site.baseurl }}/data/2021-02-21-How-I-received-my-Tier-1-Exceptional-Talent-UK-visa/TechNationApplicationForm.pdf" width="750px" height="750px">
    <embed src="{{ site.baseurl }}/data/2021-02-21-How-I-received-my-Tier-1-Exceptional-Talent-UK-visa/TechNationApplicationForm.pdf">
    </embed>
</object>

I have omitted some information for privacy reasons. You can reach me out personally if you want to know any of this information in further details.
Secondly, in the application, you need to provide a number of documents as per the [document checklist](https://technation.io/visa-tech-nation-visa-guide/#documents--evidence)
as can be seen in pages 15 and 16 of the above pdf. Below, I am providing the documents in that order:

<object data="{{ site.baseurl }}/data/2021-02-21-How-I-received-my-Tier-1-Exceptional-Talent-UK-visa/DocumentsChecklist.pdf" width="750px" height="750px">
    <embed src="{{ site.baseurl }}/data/2021-02-21-How-I-received-my-Tier-1-Exceptional-Talent-UK-visa/DocumentsChecklist.pdf">
    </embed>
</object>

Hopefully this will help you in getting an idea of what kind of documentation and in what levels of detail is that documentation required in this application process.

## Plot twist : Tech Nation rejected my application

2 months after I submitted my application, I received an email from the Home Office about the visa. My application was rejected.

<object data="{{ site.baseurl }}/data/2021-02-21-How-I-received-my-Tier-1-Exceptional-Talent-UK-visa/RejectionMail.pdf" width="750px" height="750px">
    <embed src="{{ site.baseurl }}/data/2021-02-21-How-I-received-my-Tier-1-Exceptional-Talent-UK-visa/RejectionMail.pdf">
    </embed>
</object>

They also gave me a "Proforma" explaining why I was rejected:

<object data="{{ site.baseurl }}/data/2021-02-21-How-I-received-my-Tier-1-Exceptional-Talent-UK-visa/RejectionProforma.pdf" width="750px" height="750px">
    <embed src="{{ site.baseurl }}/data/2021-02-21-How-I-received-my-Tier-1-Exceptional-Talent-UK-visa/RejectionProforma.pdf">
    </embed>
</object>

Upon reading the explanation, I realised that I have indeed compressed all of my documentations in 1 or 2-pagers and that might be the
reason they misunderstood it for me not providing the documentation in sufficient details. I did the compressing under a mistaken 
understanding that each document in the checklist must be at most 2 pages long, which was not the case. 

## Tech Nation Endorsement Review

I immediately started looking for a recourse. And as you can see in the rejection email, there is a provision to challenge the decision 
by requesting an [Endorsement Review](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/endorsement-review-for-global-talent) within 28 days of the decision. Essentially I needed to
fill up an [Endorsement Review form](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/global-talent-and-tier-1-exceptional-talent-endorsement-review-form) and email it to the Home Office. 
You can see my filled form below, which I emailed on 15th July, exactly 28 days after receiving the rejection email:

<object data="{{ site.baseurl }}/data/2021-02-21-How-I-received-my-Tier-1-Exceptional-Talent-UK-visa/EndorsementReview.pdf" width="750px" height="750px">
    <embed src="{{ site.baseurl }}/data/2021-02-21-How-I-received-my-Tier-1-Exceptional-Talent-UK-visa/EndorsementReview.pdf">
    </embed>
</object>

As you can see, I addressed precisely the points of refusal outlined in the Proforma. Having little hopes of getting the decision turned around, I received the email
from the Home Office stating that I have been granted the endorsement, as can be seen at the top of this blog.

```

## Closing words

Once I received the endorsement letter, I started the actual visa application. Once again, you can find a detailed explanation of the visa
application process on the [UK Government website](https://www.gov.uk/global-talent). Both the visa application fee as well as the endorsement fee are 
quite significant. Additionally you need to pay for a health surcharge for the number of years you want to get this visa for (3 to 5 years). I went with 5 years just 
to play it safe, although with this visa, you can get an ILR by the end of 3 years (please check if this rule changes with time). 

I hope this blog detailing my personal journey of a successful tier-1 visa application will help you in yours in terms of the documentation as well as following the process. Thanks for reading !!
